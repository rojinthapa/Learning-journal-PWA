            <h3>Week 2 - Frontend Fundamentals</h>
            <p><strong>Topics Covered:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, Mobile-First Design, Responsive Layouts</p>
            
            <h4>Journal Questions:</h4>
            <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong></p>
            <p>I started by designing for mobile screens first, using a single column layout and larger touch targets. Then I used CSS media queries to add more complex layouts for tablets and desktops. This ensured the core experience worked well on all devices.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong></p>
            <p>The most useful concept was CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating responsive layouts. Media queries were also essential for adapting the design across different screen sizes without changing the HTML structure.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</strong></p>
            <p>The most challenging part was ensuring perfect cross-browser compatibility and dealing with GitHub's limitation of not allowing empty folders. I had to add placeholder files to maintain the folder structure in the repository.</p>

            <h3>Week 1 - Introduction to PWA & Development Setup</h3>
            <p><strong>Topics Covered:</strong> PWA Basics, GitHub Setup, VS Code Integration, PythonAnywhere Deployment</p>
            
            <h4>Tasks Completed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Created GitHub account and TemperatureConverterPWA repository</li>
                <li>Set up VS Code with GitHub integration</li>
                <li>Built a Temperature Converter PWA with manifest and service worker</li>
                <li>Deployed the PWA on GitHub Pages and PythonAnywhere</li>
                <li>Explored Android Studio and Kotlin for mobile development</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Challenges Faced:</h4>
            <p><strong>GitHub Empty Folders:</strong> GitHub doesn't allow empty folders, so I had to add placeholder files (.gitkeep) to maintain the project structure.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mobile-PC Compatibility:</strong> Adjusting the PWA to work seamlessly across different devices was challenging. I had to test extensively on various screen sizes and use responsive design principles.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Service Worker Setup:</strong> Getting the service worker to properly cache resources for offline functionality required careful path configuration and testing.</p>
            
            <h4>Reflection:</h4>
            <p>This week provided a comprehensive introduction to the mobile development ecosystem. Setting up the development environment across multiple platforms (GitHub, VS Code, PythonAnywhere, Android Studio) was initially overwhelming but ultimately rewarding. The PWA approach is particularly interesting as it bridges web and mobile development.</p>
            
            <p>The most valuable lesson was understanding how different deployment platforms serve different purposes - GitHub Pages for static hosting, PythonAnywhere for potential backend services, and Android Studio for native mobile apps.</p>
